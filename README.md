# Trulioo Embed ID (Beta)

## Install

`npm install trulioo-react`

## Description

⚡**Trulioo EmbedID**⚡ (private BETA) leverages the GlobalGateway RestFul API, this API can not be invoked directly through web browser, therefore an intermediary (proxy) hosted on your web server is required to complete the request. For demonstration purposes Trulioo provides the **[trulioo-react-sample-app](https://github.com/Trulioo/trulioo-react-sample-app)** (sample code of a lightweight Node.js proxy server). Trulioo recommends developing your own intermediary (proxy) for production purposes.

## Use

```
import EmbedID from 'trulioo-react/EmbedID'

const handleResponse = (e) => {
    // handle verification submission result here ...
}

<EmbedID url='TRULIOO_PROXY_SERVER_URL' handleResponse={handleResponse} />
```

## Add Bootstrap CSS for better looks 💇🏼

## Proxy Server Quickstart

To make requests at Trulioo GlobalGateway and get around [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS), it is required that an intermediate server (proxy) in-between is used.

You have the option to develop your own, or simply use [trulioo-quickstart project](https://github.com/Trulioo/trulioo-react-sample-app), an easy to follow guide to boostrap your server 🚀.

# Best Practice

Trulioo EmbedID passes user input data to the "proxy" on your server. When developing systems that consume internet exposed fields for the purpose of data collection, ensure you take all necessary precautions to protect your system from from denial of service attacks, exploits or security vulnerabilities.
